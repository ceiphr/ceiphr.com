## KaTeX

KaTeX is a cross-browser JavaScript library that displays mathematical notation
in web browsers. It puts special emphasis on being fast and easy to use. Here's
an inline equation: $\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ . And here's a block equation:

$$
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty
    \hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}
    \,d\xi
$$

KaTeX was initially developed by Khan Academy, and became one of the top five
trending projects on GitHub in September 2014.
