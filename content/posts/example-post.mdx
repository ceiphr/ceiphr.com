## KaTeX

KaTeX is a cross-browser JavaScript library that displays mathematical notation
in web browsers. It puts special emphasis on being fast and easy to use. Here's
an inline equation: $\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ . And here's a block equation:

$$
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty
    \hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}
    \,d\xi
$$

KaTeX was initially developed by Khan Academy, and became one of the top five
trending projects on GitHub in September 2014.

## Code Hike Snippet

Build first-class code walkthroughs for the web. Whether you are writing blog
posts, documentation, tutorials, coding videos, or any type of technical
content, Code Hike helps you create a [superior code](#mark-annotation) reading
experience.

```tsx App.tsx
import React from 'react';

const Example = () => {
    // link #mark-annotation
    return <div></div>;
};

export default Example;
```

You can also do _`var x = 10`_. So, syntax highlighting works inline too.
