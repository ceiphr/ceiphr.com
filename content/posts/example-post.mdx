This is an example post, with a [link](https://nextjs.org) and a React component:

<TestComponent name="next-mdx-remote" />

$\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$

Wowowow.

The title and description are pulled from the MDX file and processed using `gray-matter`. Additionally, links are rendered using a custom component passed to `next-mdx-remote`.

Go back [home](/).

# wow this is neat

<Sandpack template="react" />;

```tsx
import React from 'react';

const Example = () => {
    return <div></div>;
};

export default Example;
```
