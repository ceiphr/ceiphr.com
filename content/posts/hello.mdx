{/* TODO: Update template */}

This is an example post, with a [link](https://nextjs.org) and a React
component:

<Spline scene="https://prod.spline.design/3iURy3G1ocdsRId3/scene.splinecode" />

The title and description are pulled from the MDX file and processed using
`gray-matter`. Additionally, links are rendered using a custom component passed
to `next-mdx-remote`.

Go back [home](/).
