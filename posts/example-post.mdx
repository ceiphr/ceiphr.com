This is an example post, with a [link](https://nextjs.org) and a React component:

<TestComponent name="next-mdx-remote" />

The title and description are pulled from the MDX file and processed using `gray-matter`. Additionally, links are rendered using a custom component passed to `next-mdx-remote`.

Go back [home](/).
